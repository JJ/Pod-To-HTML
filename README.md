# Pod::To::HTML

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/perl6/Pod-To-HTML.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/perl6/Pod-To-HTML)

Render Perl 6 Pod as HTML

## Install

This module is in the [Perl 6 ecosystem](https://modules.perl6.org), so you install it in the usual way:

    zef install Pod::To::HTML

**Note**: Perl 6 2018.06 introduces changes on how non-breaking
  whitespace was handled; this is now included in the tests. If
  the installation fails, please upgrade to Perl 6 >= 2018.06 or
  simply disregard the test and install with `--force` if that
  particular feature is of no use to you.

**Note 2**: Perl6 2018.11 introduced handling of Definition blocks,
`Defn`. Please upgrade if you are using that feature in the
documentation.

## SYNOPSIS

From the command line:

    perl6 --doc=HTML lib/FancyModule.pm > FancyModule.html

From within Perl 6:

```perl6
# Pod Block
=pod My I<super B<awesome>> embedded C<pod> document!

say Pod::To::HTML.render($=pod[0]);

# Pod file
say Pod::To::HTML.render('your/file.pod'.IO, header =>
                         "your-custom-header-inside-body", footer =>
                         "your-custom-footer-inside-body", head-fields
                         => "tags-inside-head", lang => "document
                         language (defaults to 'en')", default-title =
                         'No =title was found so we use this', css-url
                         => 'https://example.com/css.css'); # specify
                         css-url as empty string to disable CSS
                         inclusion

# Pod string

my $pod = q:to/END/;
=pod
My I<super B<awesome>> embedded C<pod>
document!
END
say Pod::To::HTML.render($pod,
    header =>"your-custom-header-inside-body",
    footer => "your-custom-footer-inside-body",
	head-fields => "tags-inside-head",
    lang => "document language (defaults to 'en')",
	default-title => 'No =title was found so we use this');

# If you want to use a specific template 
say pod2html $=pod[0], :templates("lib/templates");
# main.mustache should be in that directory


```
## DESCRIPTION

`Pod::To::HTML` takes a Pod 6 tree and outputs correspondingly
formatted HTML. Generally this is done via the command line,
using`perl6 --doc=HTML`, which extracts the pod from the document and
feeds it to `Pod::To::HTML`. The other route is with the `render`
method (called by `--doc=HTML`), which creates a complete HTML
document from the Pod tree it is called with.

Optionally, a custom header/fooder/head-fields can be
provided. These can be used to link to custom CSS stylesheets and
JavaScript libraries.
